<tr><td>Who/What/Why?</td><td>This is a tiny hobby project that was created with a simple goal in mind. Often people find themselves working late on their computers and it leads to stress, pain and discomfort. This project helps by allowing the user to set a time after which he/she should take a break. Coffee-Break will take care of the rest. You can even turn on some smooth Jazz Music on or off the break.</td></tr>
